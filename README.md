# AirtimeChallenge
Coding challenge for Airtime

This is a very simple Android app that demonstrates a solution to the Airtime Coding Challenge.

PLEASE NOTE that all feedback is through Log statements; in the interest of expediency the Android app itself will show no visual feedback whatsoever (other than the final "response" message). Please keep this in mind as you run the app; you will be able to see (DEBUG) log statements as the drones visit the different rooms.

This is packaged as a Gradle-based Android app; I created it in Android Studio but it should be fairly straightforward to set up in any Gradle-compliant IDE.

To run the app, just tap the "Start" button on the Main Activity and monitor the LogCat output.
